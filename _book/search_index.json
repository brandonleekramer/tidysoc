Kramer 2021-09-02 Chapter 1 Preface This is the documentation website for the tidysocial meta-package. tidysocial provides various tools for detecting trends and standardizing demographic, geographic, and organizational categories in messy text data. While these tools were designed for social scientists, researchers, developers, and even entrepreneurs from a variety of backgrounds are likely to find these tools helpful in their day-to-day work flows. 1.1 Package Overview Each chapter covers a different package of the tidysocial meta-package. In the first chapter, we cover tidyorgs - a package designed to detect and standardize academic, business, government and nonprofit institutions for sector classification, joining data sets, and other forms of organizational analysis. In the second chapter, we go into the identidy package. This software was designed to find skills and credentials for occupational research as well as relational factors about the social people have. In the third chapter, we detail diverstidy, which shares a number of functions for detecting terms like race, gender and other forms of diversity. The package also provides tools for detecting geographic areas and the populations that inhabit those areas, providing a natural extension for standardizing demographic categories in text data. In the final chapter, we outline tidyoss. This package was developed to detect various kinds of software types - mainly for economists to evaluate the various uses, impacts, and cost estimates of those software tools. Each chapter not only provides brief descriptions of the functions included in each package, the data and references that contributed to developing them, and several uses cases for how they might be used. The three main uses cases explored are (1) detection and standardization of academic institutions in GitHub data, (2) changes in various forms of diversity in biomedical literature over time, and (3) analysis of software types using GitHub README data. 1.2 Documentation Structure 1.3 Acknowledgements &amp; Funding "],["tidysocial.html", "Chapter 2 tidysocial 2.1 Motivation 2.2 Potential Users 2.3 Potential Use Cases", " Chapter 2 tidysocial All chapters start with a first-level heading followed by your chapter title, like the line above.

Leave the label off if you like the automated heading generated based on your heading title: for example, # Hello world = # Hello world {#hello-world}. To label an un-numbered heading, use: # Hello world {-#nice-label} or {# Hello world .unnumbered}. Next, reference the labeled heading anywhere in the text using \\@ref(nice-label); for example, please see Chapter 3. If you prefer text as the link instead of a numbered reference use: any text you want can go here. Figures and tables with captions can also be cross-referenced from elsewhere in your book using \\@ref(fig:chunk-label) and \\@ref(tab:chunk-label), respectively.
